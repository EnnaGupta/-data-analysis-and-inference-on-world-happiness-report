# About the project

In the project, I learnt different aspects of the World Happiness report. Collected data on the world happiness index, GDP of countries , life expectancy, trust in government , generosity etc. and tried to find correlations between these and the happiness index. Also used other parameters in the dataset like poverty index and Literacy rate, and compared them with the other factors of the world happiness report, to see whether they are significantt enough to be included in the report at all.
